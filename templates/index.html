    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <p>We have written a script to scrape data from your Spotify account. Once the data collection is complete, the website emails us your data. We will spend several minutes in person discussing your music, then manually type up our opinions and send them back to the website, which displays the results.</p>
    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>Benjy and Will</p>
    <h2>Are you affiliated with Spotify?</h2>
    <p>No. Spotify has extensive <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/" target="_blank">API documentation</a> that allows developers to play with data. It also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211019054153/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/technology/streaming-music-economics.html" target="_blank">pays its artists next to nothing</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxxkn/musicians-are-dragging-spotifys-ceo-for-funding-a-military-ai-company" target="_blank">has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to military contractors</a>, and we are two college students who made this 12 hours before it was due.</p>
