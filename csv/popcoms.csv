40,there's a reason some music is popular,whoa your taste is VERY out there. you're either far ahead of the zeitgeist or far far behind it. shine on you beautiful dreamer
50,so you listen to music like benjy does. they're sitting next to me right now. you have good music taste. i am not being forced to say this.,once i played a song for my mom and she was like 'this would fit right in on NPR's Morning Becomes Eclectic.' that's kind of how i feel about your music
60,"the big computer in the sky says your music taste is as basic or as out there as mine, i'm a fan",seems like you're about as adventurous music-wise as will. his favorite album is the minecraft soundtrack so grain of salt
70,"you have a healthy mix of all sorts of music. you don't shy away from some popular tracks, and you're also not some pretentious music purist","solid mix of music here leaning toward maybe lesser-known stuff. you could be a DJ at a medium-size radio station, or my cool 11th grade math teacher"
80,placeholder text for will=80,i like your music overall! some of it is mainstream some is more indie either way you wanna be a trailblazer. leo is in the twelfth house. i have no idea what i'm talking about
90,"listen, if a lot of people like a certain song, then it's probably pretty good. it seems to work out well for everything else, like politics, or movies, or food",i feel like i can kinda pinpoint this. you have mostly well-known artists with some other stuff mixed in. good vibes all around
100,sheep,okkkk lots of very popular songs here. i respect the hustle. the algorithm is gonna come for us all in the end
